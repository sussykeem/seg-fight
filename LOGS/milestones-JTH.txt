    	2 hours discussing ideas with the full group 2/18
	2 hours spent setting up unity and watching various tutorials on the basics
	1 hour messing around with various unity objects and seeing how they work
	1 hour spent making a health bar and player health manager

I am completely new to unity so getting everything set up and figuring out what to do was a challenge.
Luckily there are various quickstart guides on the internet that made it a bit easier.
The health bar was easy enough, just had to dabble in scripting to figure it out.

Our project needs a solid backbone we can build off of before we start adding anything fancy and unnessesary.

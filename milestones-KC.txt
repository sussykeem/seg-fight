The idea for a project is a game, most likely made in Unity
    Some ideas we have floated around are a fighting game, an rpg, or an idle game

Rubric:
    +20 points - time spent working
    +5 points - creativity
    +10 points - the project actualy works
    +5 points - uses a data structure

time log
    2 hours dicussing ideas/making the milestones/rubric - lab
    2 hours discussing ideas with the full group 2/18
    2 hours spent watching tutorials for unity and player movement 2/18
    30 minutes spent implementing a simple update function that handles 2d movement

Because I have previous experience with unity and game dev, I just needed a refresher on how to do some stuff but implementation
went pretty smoothly. The animator gave me some trouble with the bool values.

The next steps we need to take are coming up with a style, idea for the game, what the main loop will look like, and designating
different sections of the project to people.

My file is titled playerMove.cs
